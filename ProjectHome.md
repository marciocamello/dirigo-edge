Edge is an Open Source CMS built from the ground up to be Responsive.

Every aspect of Edge is designed responsively. Not only will your front-facing website look great, but you can easily administer it on any internet-connected device.

Edge is built on cutting edge technologies :

1. The Frontend is designed to allow you to use any Front End Framework. Start from scratch, add in Bootstrap, or use the included Foundation template.

2. HTML5 Boilerplate integration ensures best practices.

3. The Interaction Layer is designed around jQuery and AJAX/JSON Restfull components.

4. The backend layer is built using the Microsoft's Code First Framework, allowing for rapid prototyping and production-ready database layers. This also allows for seamless database updates and a pain free installation process.

5. There is an extensive Plugin System, Schema Builder, Shortcodes, Modules, SEO tools , and much more.
